RESPONSE:
The causes of poor nutrition in women include poor-quality diets, poor services, poor practices, and a weak enabling environment. Women's access to diets and care are constrained by factors such as limited availability of and access to nutritious, safe, and affordable foods; limited opportunities for women to access nutrition services; limited knowledge of the importance of preconception nutrition care; and harmful gendered social norms and social and cultural practices (Source: Document 9, Page 12).
