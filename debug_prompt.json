It is increasingly being used to assess the nutritional status of pregnant women and determine their eligibility for nutrition support programmes, especially in emergency or humanitarian contexts when measuring weight and height may be difficult.\u20192\u00b0\"78 The MUAC\n\nDocument 2 (Source: app/data\\Maternal Nutrition Programming Guidance.pdf, Page: 1): UNICEF PROGRAMMING GUIDANCE\n\nDocument 3 (Source: data\\Maternal Nutrition Programming Guidance.pdf, Page: 31): cm to <23 cm to identify women at nutritional risk.'* Because a recommendation for a universal MUAC cut-off for pregnant women has yet to be established, countries should consider undertaking a cost-benefit analysis to identify a context-specific MUAC cut-off.'2\u00b0 122\n\nDocument 4 (Source: app/data\\Maternal Nutrition Programming Guidance.pdf, Page: 4): Low birthweight\n\nDocument 5 (Source: data\\Maternal Nutrition Programming Guidance.pdf, Page: 31): not feasible before or early in pregnancy, a MUAC measurement may be used as an alternative to BMI to identify pregnant women who are underweight and to determine the prevalence of underweight in the population.'2\u00b0'2!
